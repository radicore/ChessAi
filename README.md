# ChessAi
ChessAi Bot that you can play against (WIP)
# Limitations and Advantages

- Project still in development, expect bugs
- K16_1 roughly takes 1 to play at a depth of 3
- Endgames may be difficult for the computer to find, but different evaluation modes will be added to enhance K16's performance
- This project will be regularly updated locally (uploading more long term)
- Kyro16 engine assumes it always will play as white first

# Currently in progress

- Engine types: faster, slower (more accurate, supposedly), and blend of both (however only K16_1 and K16_2 work)
- Evaluation method improvements and more evaluation functions
