# ChessAi
ChessAi Bot that you can play against (WIP)
# Limitations and Advantages

- Project still in development, expect bugs
- K16_1 roughly takes 1 to play at a depth of 3
- Endgames with a checkmate in 8+ moves the computer probably will not see, but I will be trying to improve this

+ This project will be regularly updated locally (uploading more long term)
+ Kyro16 engine assumes it always will play as white first

# Currently in progress

+ Engine types: faster, slower (more accurate, supposedly), and blend of both (however only K16_1 and K16_2 work)
+ Evaluation method improvements and more evaluation functions
