# ChessAi Introduction
K16 (Kyro 16) is a chess minimax algorithm that uses a range of functions to determine what and where it moves with a **main** depth of three (3 moves ahead into the future). The depth will increase throuhout the game based on the number of pieces are on the board.

# Limitations and Advantages

- Project still in development, expect bugs
- Endgames may be difficult for the computer to find, but different evaluation modes will be added to enhance K16's performance
- This project will be regularly updated locally (uploading more long term)
- K16 engine assumes it will **always** play as white first, I may be adding an implementation in the future where this can be changed

# Currently in progress

- Engine types: faster, slower (more accurate, supposedly), and blend of both (however only K16_1 and K16_2 work)
- Evaluation method improvements and more evaluation functions
- This is a WIP chess bot so moves are based on its own evaluation of position methods
